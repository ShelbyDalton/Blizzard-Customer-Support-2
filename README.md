Blizzard Customer Support 2

PROBLEM SOLVED
This application will solve {the problem of Blizzard’s customer service system in its current state which is totally useless} 
for {the players of their games}. 
OVERVIEW 
The application will provide a more user friendly platform to quickly submit a ticket for a problem that a player is 
experiencing in their favorite Blizzard game. As opposed to the wild goose chase that is in their current ticketing platform 
to just find where to begin a ticket. 


PROJECT MVP FEATURES
The user can register and login with an email. 
The user can CREATE a new ticket.
The user can DELETE  a ticket they have created if they have resolved the issue on their own. 
The user will be able to edit their ticket if details have changed.
The user will be able to change their profile details which will include their favorite game and how long they have been playing it. 
The ‘support’ who address the tickets will be able to ‘claim’ the tickets and ‘complete’ them. 
The ‘support’ will also have the ability to edit their profile which will include the game they work with and their pay rate. 
If the user is a ‘support’, they will be able to see all tickets,  all player information, and all support information on the 
‘tickets’, ‘players’, and ‘supports’ pages respectively. The users who are ‘players’ will not be able to see any tickets except for 
their own and will not have access to the ‘player’ or ‘support’ lists or ‘player’/’support’ information pages.

PROJECT ADDITIONAL FEATURES
I would like to expand on the player and support profiles to include more information. 
I would like the support profiles to display for the players to let the players see who is helping them. 
I would like to include a game catalog of Blizzard games that ‘players’ can favorite and ‘supports’ can add/edit/remove. 
Login with a password instead of just an email (unless the password code is provided).
